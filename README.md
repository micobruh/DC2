## Notebooks in Google Colab
For LSTM model (NN Urban, NN Suburban, NN Rural), it is recommended to run it on Google Colab because it makes use of GPU. Also make sure the google drive file is saved in MyDrive before running the code. Change the directory of storing "all_variables.csv" when necessary.

* Google Drive [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1is99wePaVuIFQR_-r9_i3ja4hOUnyfEI?usp=sharing)

The Dataset is located in the `all_variables.zip` file, you must take the dataset csv file from that file to have it read by the model.
